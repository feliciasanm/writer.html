This is a distraction-free writer I made for myself around three years ago. I wanted to write a story at that time, but I decided that I wanted to build a writer for that purpose before I started writing. I polished it up a bit one year later, and this is the writer that I ended up producing. In the end, I didn't write any story using the writer, but I did use it for some of my college assignments.

I will add documentation on how to use it later and update a few parts according to my current knowledge.
